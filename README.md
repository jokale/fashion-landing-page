# Fashion Brand prelaunch landing page 



This project is a minimal pre launch site for a fashion company. 
Within this project I will be utilising styled components and React.js Functional Components as well as Hooks to ensure the code is more effecient due to the fact I am not pertaining any state. In addition I will ensure the webpage is able to be sized to fit desktop sized devices. 

I also used [React Countdown Component](https://github.com/ndresx/react-countdown) to create a countdown on my page for when the fashion brand will launch. 

Will be uploaded on Vercel once complete.

Available on [Fashion Prelaunch page](https://fashion-landing-page-eight.vercel.app/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
